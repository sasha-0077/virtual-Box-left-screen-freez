# virtual-Box-left-screen-freez
solution for the left half of  Linux desktop becomes unresponsive to left mouse button clicks. 
Left-mouse button clicks do continue to work on the right half portion of the screen. 
Actually, it is not the entire left-half portion of the screen that is affected; more like approximately the left two/fifths (left 40%) portion of the entire screen. 
The screen.sh file will fix this problem when it appears.
